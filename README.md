# Dex - Statistical Data Analysis Tool with PyQt6

This project is the outcome of a master's thesis focused on creating a tool for statistical data analysis. Dex, the
developed tool, provides a graphical environment built using PyQt6, a robust Python framework for desktop applications.

## Key Features

- **Statistical Data Analysis:** Dex facilitates efficient exploration and interpretation of statistical data.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The application offers a user-friendly graphical interface, enhancing the overall
  user experience.

## Technological Stack

- **PyQt6:** The primary framework used for building the graphical environment and implementing various UI components.

- **Python:** The core programming language employed for the development of Dex.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
